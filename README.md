Semantic Technologies for Health

This public repository is a collection of information, links, ideas and points of views; on the application of semantic technologies to health.

Semantic Technology is defined as:

"Encodes meanings separately from data and content files, and separately from application code.
This enables machines as well as people to understand, share and reason with them at execution time."
*Wikipedia*

As such the Semantic Web is considered a subdomain of Semantic Technology.

Health is defined as:

"Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity."
*World Health Organization. Constitution of the World Health Organization Basic Documents, Forty-fifth edition, Supplement, October 2006. WHO, Geneva.*
